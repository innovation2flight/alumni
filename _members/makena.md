Hi! My name is Makena, and I'm planning to graduate from UC Berkeley with an astrophysics degree and an EECS minor in Spring 2021. At Berkeley, I serve as the high-altitude balloon team lead for Space Technologies at Cal. I also have experience as a researcher studying exoplanets, more specifically biases in K2 Campaign proposals. Additionally, I have experience teaching and creating content for the astronomy course Python for Astronomers. I'm passionate about balloon-borne payload integration and science, direct imaging of exoplanets, telescope mechanics, iterative design processes, data visualization, and public outreach. My hobbies include SCUBA diving, astrophotography, and skiing.
