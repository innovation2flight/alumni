My name is Rohan, and I'm a Computer Science major studying at the University of Wisconsin - Madison (2020). I primarily work with software development and hardware design, particularily in robotics and satellites. Outside of CS-related fields I enjoy flying RC aircraft and I play the bass trombone in several ensembles at UW. During summer 2018 I focused on the hardware and software design for the Zephyrus flight vehicle, as well as its integration with the Talos balloon autolauncher and return-to-home vehicle.
