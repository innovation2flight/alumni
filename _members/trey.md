My name is Trey and I'm an Engineering Physics major at UC Berkeley, class of 2019. I'm passionate about robotics, control, and autonomy, especially in the context of aerospace systems. I conduct research involving vehicle design and control for quadcopters at UC Berkeley, and have spent some time working on vision systems in the automotive industry. I spent the summer of 2018 working at JPL in the i2F program working on hardware and software for the Talos autolauncher and its supporting systems including our antenna trackers.
