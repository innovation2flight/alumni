Howdy, I'm Hunter. I am an astrophysics major at UC Berkeley (class of 2020) and have been working on the Innovation to Flight program since May of 2017. I mostly work with high altitude systems and autonomous sUAS', though I am interested in a variety of research areas. These include supersonic flight, sub-orbital to orbital vehicle transitions, interplanetary autonomous systems, cislunar economies/opportunities, long-range communication systems, and bio-inspired design. I spent the summer of 2018 working on the Talos autonomous balloon launching system and the Zephyrus high altitud flight vehicle, as well as the integration of the two systems.
