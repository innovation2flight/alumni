My name is Samar and I'm a Mechanical Engineering major at The University of Houston. I am very passionate about advanced propulsion, in-space manufacturing, solid mechanics, systems engineering and autonomous systems. My experiences include interning at Ad Astra Rocket Company and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as well as being an undergraduate researcher at NASA's USIP Program. As a part of i2f I spent most of my time working on the Talos autolauncher and an experimental camera payload.
