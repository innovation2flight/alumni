I completed my Bachelors of Science in Engineering in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan in April 2018 and am currently completing my Master's of Science in Engineering in Space Engineering. After three summers working with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, I have developed a keen interest in systems engineering with particular research interests in Lunar exporation and in-situ resource utilization and alternative propulsion systems. In my free time I enjoy scuba diving and international travel.
