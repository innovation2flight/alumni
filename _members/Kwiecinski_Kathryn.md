My name is Kate Kwiecinski and I am in the University of Minnesota's class of 2020 majoring in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics. Some of my experiences include serving as a research assistant at the University of Minnesota, and interning at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for Talos. My passions are advanced structures and structural analysis, orbital debris modeling and risk assessment, in-space manufacturing, experimental aviation, deep space habitation, and advanced spacecraft propulsion. My hobbies are rock-climbing, playing the cello, playing with dogs, and baking chocolatey desserts.
