My name is Roxanna Pakkar and I study electrical engineering at the University of Southern California where I will be graduating in 2020. I serve as a research assistant in the USC Interaction Lab focusing on socially assistive robotics. At NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory I have been working on a team devoloping an autonomous multi-agent system. My research interests include swarm autonomy, personal robotics, and human-robot interaction.
